<!-- Below is the Beethoven and His Father Section of the Biography-->
     
  <h3 class="text">Beethoven and his Father:</h3>
      <p class="text" id="Beethoven-father">Beethoven had a complicated relationship with his father, Johann van Beethoven. His father introduced him to music, which Beethoven had a passion for; however, the way Johann taught him was cruel. He used barbaric methods such as: beating beethoven when he missed a note, sleep depriving him(due to practicing piano excessively),  and locking him in a cellar. The passion of music was drained out of Beethoven because of his father, yet he was a talented young musician. It is unclear whether this is because of his father, or just luck, either way he was a young prodigy.

      <p class="text" id="Beethoven-father-2">
        Later in life Johann would get deep into alcoholism, meaning that income for the family was weak. This forced Beethoven to try to get a job as an Assistant Court Organist, and despite only being 13 years old, he was accepted.

<!--Below is the Beethoven's Early education Section of the biography-->\
 
  <h3 class="text" >Beethoven's Early Education</h3>
    <p class="text" id="Education">Beethoven attended a Latin grade 6, in which no one saw the genius hidden behind the young boy. In fact he was an average student. It must have left the school astounded when he became famous. He only attended grade school till the age of 10. This age is when he dropped out to study music full time with Christian Gottlob Neefe(a court Organist). His father wanted Beethoven to be recognised as a musician; therefore they arranged a recital for the school: Wolfgang Motzart. He did not get in. Beethoven however, did not get discouraged, and published his first composition at the age of 12. People theorize that Beethoven studied with Motzart(best composer in Europe at the time); however we do not know for sure. It is confirmed that was sent to Vienna(Europe's Capital of Culture and Music) by the court in 1787 to hone his musical skill. Everyone saw potential in Beethoven; however, not yet was he recognized as a mastermind of music.  </p>
