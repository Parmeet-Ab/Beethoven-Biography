 <!-- Below is the Birth and Family Section of the Biography-->

   <h3 class="text" >Birth and Family:</h3>
      <p class="text" id="Birth-Family">Beethoven was born on December 16, 1770 in the city of Bonn, which was within the Electorate Of Cologne(Territory of Holy Roman Empire). He had two younger brothers, Casper(born in 1774) and Johann( born in 1778), who survived to adulthood. His mother, Maria Magdalena van Beethoven, was described as very kind, caring, and gentle. Beethoven's father; however, was an alcoholic, and abusive; scaring Beethoven's childhood.

<!-- Below is the Beethoven and His Father Section of the Biography-->
     
  <h3 class="text">Beethoven and his Father:</h3>
      <p class="text" id="Beethoven-father">Beethoven had a complicated relationship with his father, Johann van Beethoven. His father introduced him to music, which Beethoven had a passion for; however, the way Johann taught him was cruel. He used barbaric methods such as: beating beethoven when he missed a note, sleep depriving him(due to practicing piano excessively),  and locking him in a cellar. The passion of music was drained out of Beethoven because of his father, yet he was a talented young musician. It is unclear whether this is because of his father, or just luck, either way he was a young prodigy.

      <p class="text" id="Beethoven-father-2">
        Later in life Johann would get deep into alcoholism, meaning that income for the family was weak. This forced Beethoven to try to get a job as an Assistant Court Organist, and despite only being 13 years old, he was accepted.

<!--Below is the Beethoven's Early education Section of the biography-->\
 
  <h3 class="text" >Beethoven's Early Education</h3>
    <p class="text" id="Education">Beethoven attended a Latin grade 6, in which no one saw the genius hidden behind the young boy. In fact he was an average student. It must have left the school astounded when he became famous. He only attended grade school till the age of 10. This age is when he dropped out to study music full time with Christian Gottlob Neefe(a court Organist). His father wanted Beethoven to be recognised as a musician; therefore they arranged a recital for the school: Wolfgang Motzart. He did not get in. Beethoven however, did not get discouraged, and published his first composition at the age of 12. People theorize that Beethoven studied with Motzart(best composer in Europe at the time); however we do not know for sure. It is confirmed that was sent to Vienna(Europe's Capital of Culture and Music) by the court in 1787 to hone his musical skill. Everyone saw potential in Beethoven; however, not yet was he recognized as a mastermind of music.  </p>
  
  <!--Below is the Master Pieces of Beethoven Section -->
        <h3 class="text">The Master Pieces of Beethoven</h3>
        <p class="text" id="Master-Peice"> Beethoven created many amazing musical pieces during his time. In fact he was so great that when he was just 19 he was given the honor of performing a musical piece during the funeral of Joseph II(The Holy Roman Empire Emperor). Beethoven did not perform for unknown reasons; however, he created a beautiful piece called Cantat on the Death of Emperor Joseph II for the funeral. It is now considered his first masterpiece. Later Beethoven would continue to make musical pieces, even though deaf. Pieces such as he first piano concerto in C major, fur elise, Symphony No.7 are just some of his great music creations.

        <!-- Below is the His time in Vienna Section-->
        <h3 class="text">His time in Vienna</h3>
        <p class="text" id="Time-Vienna">Beethoven, in 1792, left for Vienna due to French revolutionary forces invading the Electorate of Cologne. In Vienna Beethoven searched for a teacher. Since Motzart had passed away, he wanted to learn from the greatest composer alive, Joseph Hayden. Beethoven studied with Haydn, Antonio Saleri, and Johann Alberchtsbeger. All three helped him become a better composer. Beethoven, being recognised as a prodigy, received financial support from the high class people of Vienna- known as the Viennese aristocracy. In 1795 Beethoven made his public debut in Vienna, playing his first piano concerto in C Major. Then, in 1800, inside the Royal Imperial Theater located in Vienna, he debuted his Symphony No.1 in C Major. Even though the musical piece established him as a great composer, he would later deteste the piece saying: “In those days I did not know how to compose.” He continued to make popular pieces such as his Six String Quartets, and The Creatures of Prometheus. Beethoven still continued to create pieces even though he started losing hearing at around 1801.
